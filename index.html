    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>My name is Abimbola Ajayi, I am a motivated & seasoned customer support expert. 
        I started out my career in UBA as a customer experience expert handling minimum of 120 
        conversation daily and during times when there are backlogs or large inflows of conversations,
         I go beyond the 120 daily conversation.
        Also, I transitioned into the fashion industry as Business Development Manager at Bankole Clothiers 
        which is an indigenous clothing brand with branches within & outside Africa. 
        My role as Business Development Manager at Bankole Clothiers involves giving clients 
        excellent customer experience, escalating their queries to the right department & ensuring that 
        resolutions are met at the speculated timeline. Also, I also upsell & cross sell different clothing
         brands for our clients while ensuring customer retention is achieved.
        After my experience at Bankole Clothiers, I moved to PayDay which is a Fintech as a 
        Customer Experience Associate and I currently handle clients conversations, providing timely support,
        escalating queries to the tech team when needed and ensuring customers have a super amazing experience
         that will lead to customer retention.
        Currently, I am transitioning from customer support to front-end development and this is a significant shift that
         encompasses both personal and professional growth. 
        This essay explores the journey of an individual who made this transition, 
        highlighting the motivations,
         challenges, and successes experienced along the way.<p>

<section id="section2">
    <h1>Early Career in Customer Support</h1>
    <p>I began their career in customer support, working in the banking sector, United Bank for Africa (UBA) specifically . 
        This role involved:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Assisting customers through calls, mails and chats with technical issues, providing solutions,
                 and ensuring customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Developing strong communication and problem-solving skills.</li>
            <li>Gaining an in-depth understanding of the company's products and services.
                The daily interactions with customers offered valuable insights into user 
                experiences and common issues, 
                sparking an interest in improving the user interface and experience.</li>
        </ol>
</section>


<section id="section3">
    <h1>Motivation for Transition</h1>
    <p>I had some factors that served as my driving force for transition. The desire to transition into front-end development from customer support stemmed from:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A growing interest in technology and web development.</li>
        <li>The realization that many customer issues could be resolved through better 
            design and user interfaces.</li>
        <li>A passion for creativity and the urge to build something tangible.
            This individual decided to pursue their passion, 
            recognizing that a career in front-end development would allow them to have a
             more direct impact on the user experience.</li>
        <li>I wanted to invest in a skill that will transcend now and one which will be relevant in the nearest future</li>
        <li>I also wanted to broaden and increase my income</li>
        <li>I have the dream of fusing my experience from customer support into tech to use it to build a CRM platform</li>
        <li>I also envisage working on the loophole i have noticed in some CRM tools and try to bridge the gap</li>
    </ol>

<section id="section4">
    <h1>Acquiring New Skills</h1>
    <p>To make the transition seamless for me, I highlighted the steps that will take me to where I am looking
        at being in the nearest future, part of which are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Education: This is what I am currently acquiring in Altschool the moment.</li>
        <li>Practice: I try to put what I have been taught in class to use so as to gain hands-on experience.</li>
        <li>Mentorship: Sought guidance from experienced developer friends within the tech industry and 
            participated in coding communities, e.g Tech4dev, Web3ladies and now Altschool </br>
            Learning can be challenging, 
            but the my dedication and passion for development and growth kept me motivated.</li>
    </ol>
</section>


<section id="section5">
    <h1>Overcoming Challenges</h1>
    <p>The transition was not without its difficulties:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Time Management: Juggling the demands of a customer support role
             while learning to code required excellent time management skills.</li>
        <li>Imposter Syndrome: Moving into a new field often brought 
            feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy. Having several meetings with myself to remind myself of my goals, 
            having a supportive spouse and my family member have helped me so far</li>
        <li>Technical Hurdles: Learning complex programming concepts and debugging code were 
            significant challenges. </br>
            Despite these obstacles, perseverance and a supportive network helped the individual 
            overcome these hurdles. 
            Each small success in coding reinforced their determination to transition fully.</li>
        <li>The ambiguity of some part of tech and some terminologies can be draining especially
            for one that did niot have a Computer Science background in the University, I always
            need dig deeper than what the book/material is saying to fully grasp what is being 
            communiicated at times.
        </li>
        <li>The knowledge of where to seek for help is important, in these few years i have been able 
            find and know the right channels to go to aside from my developer friends 
            when I am faced difficulties
        </li>
    </ol>
</section>



<section id="section6">
    <h1>Future Goals and Aspirations</h1>
    <p>Looking ahead, I have several goals laid out for myself within a short timeframe, part of which are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Professional Development: I aim to become a Full-stack engineer,
             mastering advanced technologies and leading projects. I am very much aware that this is a journey that will
            take year and a series of skill and i have been able break it into subgoals and the first part of 
        the goal is what i am doing in Altschool now.</li>
        <li>User-Centric Design: Continue to advocate for user-centric design principles, 
            ensuring that products are both functional and intuitive, especially because of my dream of fusing
        customer support and tech together.</li>
        <li>Mentorship: Help others who are looking to transition into tech by sharing my
            experiences and offering guidance because teaching is also one thing i love.</br>
            The journey from customer support to front-end development has been transformative, 
            providing a clear direction for future career growth.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Transitioning from customer support to front-end development is a challenging yet rewarding journey. 
        It requires dedication, continuous learning, and the courage to step out of one's comfort zone.
